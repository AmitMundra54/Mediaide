                    Quality healthcare is expensive anywhere in the world. Very few countries have truly universal healthcare and some of those that do donâ€™t offer free healthcare. The citizens still need to pay for their health insurance. For millions of people in developed countries like the United States, Canada and United Kingdom along with a few nations in Europe, advanced healthcare is almost unaffordable. Spending up to $200,000 for bone marrow transplant or around $3,000 for dental implants is beyond reckoning for a significant majority. This compels many to either avoid medical intervention or to look for alternatives.
                    There is no better alternative than fully integrated and affordable yet state of the art healthcare available in India. The thought of having to fly halfway across the world to a country one may not have been to can be quite unnerving. It is not just about the healthcare when it comes to medical tourism. One has to manage the visas, international flights, accommodation, doctor appointments and planning a remedial course at a chosen hospital. The choice of hospital alone can be a daunting challenge as there are plenty of options and one may have limited awareness of the quality of healthcare in India.
