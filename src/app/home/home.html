    <h3>QUALITY HEALTH CARE
    </h3>
    <p>India is second to none when it comes to state of the art fully integrated healthcare. The fact that there are so many doctors of Indian origin in the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore among other regions in the world is a testimony to their reliability and expertise. The only reason why medical treatments is more affordable in India compared to the US, the UK or Singapore is the currency. Bypass surgery costs $25,000 in the UK and $35,000 in the US. The same costs $6,000 in India. From Lasik surgery to in-vitro fertilization, everything is exponentially more affordable. </p>
