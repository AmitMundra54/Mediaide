            avoid any kind of problem in medical treatment or process:

            <li>
                First of all, you must make sure that the hospital in India that you are visiting is licensed or not. It has recognition
                from a Joint Commission International, a commission or any international healthcare auditing agency. The
                quality and the cost of the patient care are two other important considerations.

            <li>
                Then, try to gather all the important details about the doctors at the hospital before you select them. Look up for their
                qualifications, credential, and achievements. Internet makes things easier.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another important thing is that the patient should be well aware about the treatment and procedure that you are seeking so
                that your expectations from the surgery are realistic. He or she must also have knowledge about physical
                therapy, period of recovery, and post-surgery care.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not forget to meet your doctor before the procedures start. Before anything, thorough personal examination and tests of
                the patients are done by most of the hospitals, before performing any medical process. There is also a possibility
                that the doctor might not consider you fit for the treatment and might also suggest another treatment after
                the diagnosis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make a file or a folder of all the necessary documents along with their photocopy. Keep the originals at a safe place.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make another file of all the medical reports, and health records such as health history, X-rays, photograph, scans, MRI’s
                immunization records, etc., that are related to the medical process.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure you have your Visa and Passport, along with other things like traveller’s check, credit cards, debit cards, and
                yes, some local currency too.
